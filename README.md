# CapstoneProject-DSML
Project objective:
  The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the critical temperature of materials based on their elemental and physical properties. 
  By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of engineered features such as atomic mass, electron affinity, and thermal conductivity, the model aims to identify patterns that govern superconducting behavior and provide insights into material design for advanced technological 
  applications.
